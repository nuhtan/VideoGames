### Gameplay 
The gameplay of this Pokemon game makes major departures from the standard pokemon formula that has been around for decades but still holds on to a few details that hinder this major open world transition for the series. 

The open world nature of this game may disappoint some as it takes the approach of having multiple distinct open areas that the player is free to explore much like Super Mario Odyssey or Metro Exodus. This decision works out fine and likely made development and optimization during development significantly easier. Each of the open areas tries to stand out with varying success, this attempted distinction between the various areas is attempted with variation in Pokemon, color pallette differences, level design, and story progression. These attempts to differentiate the different areas start to fall flat as there are pokemon that are shared between areas, similar color swatches used in multiple areas and the story based progression is repeated for the most part in all five of these areas. The different areas have a decent amount of vertical variety that helps them from being overly repetitive and helps bring an almost metroidvania sense of exploration as you unlock the ability to explore previously unreachable areas.

Speaking of abilities the game has five abilities that you unlock in the form of riding special Pokemon that will help you traverse the areas. These abilities are by no means made equal though as you have the following: faster land traversal and jumping, hidden object detection, swimming, climbing, gliding. The worst offender by far is the hidden object detection, it is rarely used outside of a few side quests and is mostly boring, the attempt at making it interesting was through making the mount accelerate when traveling towards a hidden object but fall flat in utility and entertainment. The land traversal, swimming, and climbing all feel pretty well balanced and really opened up new areas of the maps. The gliding feels a bit awkward as by the time you get it you can already traverse all of the map and you need to start at a high location as it is gliding not flying.

One aspect that was very well implemented is the new catching system. Players are now running around the world and aiming snd throwing the various balls at pokemon. This simple system is enhanced by having some pokemon being aggresive and require being stunned if not caught unawares. Along with different reactions depending on the type of pokemon there are new pikeballs that have different floght characteristics such as flight ball that is great for catching flying pokemon. This new catching system ties into the crafting system as you will be throwing plenty of pokeballs. There are various resources that you can find around the open worlds with some being unique to each location and some being common throughout all of them. The system is simple and fits in flawlessly with my only fripe being that you need to go into your inventory and activate an item to get to the crafting menu when out in the open world.
